  <li>
<strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong>: Consider a graph \(G = \{V, E\}\) where \(V = \{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n\}\) and \(n = |V|\) is the number of nodes. Each node \(v_i\) has a feature vector \(x_i\). Modern GNNs update node representations iteratively by aggregating information from neighbours. The representation of node \(v_i\) at layer \(l\) is \(h^{(l)}_i\), with \(h_i^{(0)} = x_i\). The aggregation and combination at layer \(l\) are defined as: 
\(a_{i}^{(l)}=\text{AGGREGATE}^{(l)}\left(\left\{h_{j}^{(l-1)}: j \in \mathcal{N}(v_i)\right\}\right)\) 
\(h_{i}^{(l)}=\text{COMBINE}^{(l)}\left(h_{i}^{(l-1)}, a_{i}^{(l)}\right)\) 
where \(\mathcal{N}(v_i)\) is the set of first or higher-order neighbours of \(v_i\). Common aggregation functions include MEAN, MAX, and SUM. The COMBINE function fuses neighbor information into the node representation. For graph-level tasks, a READOUT function aggregates node features \(h_i^{(L)}\) from the final iteration into a graph representation \(h_G\):
\(h_{G}=\operatorname{READOUT}\left(\left\{h_{i}^{(L)} \mid v_i \in G \right\}\right)\)
READOUT can be a simple summation or a more complex pooling function.

<strong>Graph Level Representation (READOUT)</strong>: In general, a READOUT function is any function of the final-layer node representations from a GNN that we can use as a graph-level representation. So \(h_G = \text{READOUT}(\{h_i^{(L)}\})\) is a graph-level representation. 
A MEAN-READOUT is a simple example of a READOUT function, where the graph-level representation is the mean of the node representations.</li>

<strong>Transformer</strong>: The Transformer architecture comprises layers with two main components: a self-attention module and a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN). Let \(H = [h_1^\top, \cdots, h_n^\top]^\top\in ℝ^{n\times d}\) be the input to the self-attention module, where \(d\) is the hidden dimension and \(h_i\in ℝ^{1\times d}\) is the hidden representation at position \(i\). The input \(H\) is projected using matrices \(W_Q\inℝ^{d\times d_K}, W_K\inℝ^{d\times d_K}\), and \(W_V\inℝ^{d\times d_V}\) to obtain representations \(Q, K, V\). Self-attention is computed as:
\(Q = HW_Q,\ K = HW_K,\ V = HW_V,\ A = \frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_K}},\ Attn(H) = \text{softmax}(A)V\)
where \(A\) captures the similarity between queries and keys. This self-attention mechanism allows the model to understand relevant information in the sequence comprehensively.</li>
</ul>

<!-- For simplicity of illustration, we consider the single-head self-attention and assume $$d_K = d_V = d$$. The extension to the multi-head attention is standard and straightforward, and we omit bias terms for simplicity. xxxx One of the main properties of the Transformer that makes it so effective in processing sequences is its ability to model long-range dependencies and contextual information with its receptive field. Specifically, each token in the input sequence can interact with (or pay “attention” to) every other token in the sequence when transforming its representation xxxx. -->

The goal of this encoding is to capture the most important nodes in the graph.

Let’s take an example.
Say we want to compare airports and find which one is the largest.
We need a common metric to compare them, so we take the sum of the total daily incoming and outgoing flights, giving us the busiest airports. This is what the algorithm is doing logically to identify the ‘busiest’ nodes.
Additionally, the learnable vectors allow the Graphormer to ‘map’ out the nodes. All this culminates in better performance for graph-based tasks such as molecule generation.

<h3 id="spatial-encoding">Spatial Encoding</h3>

<p>There are several methods for encoding the position information of the tokens in a sequence.
In a graph, however, there is a problem. Graphs consist of nodes (analogous to tokens) connected with edges in a non-linear, multi-dimensional space.

<p>There are several methods for encoding the position information of the tokens in a sequence.
In a graph, however, there is a problem. 
Graphs consist of nodes (analogous to tokens) connected with edges in a non-linear, multi-dimensional space. 
There’s no inherent notion of an “ordering” or a “sequence” in its structure, but as with positional information, it’ll be helpful if we inject some sort of structural information when we process the graph.</p>

<p>The authors propose a novel encoding called <em>Spatial Encoding</em>. 
Take a pair of nodes (analogous to tokens) as input and output a scalar value as a function, \(\phi(v_i, v_j)\). The authors choose \(\phi(v_i, v_j)\) to be shortest path distance (SPD) between the nodes. 
This scalar value is then added to the element corresponding to the operation between the two nodes in the Query-Key product matrix.</p>

Graphormer’s edge encoding method significantly enhances the way the model incorporates structural features from graph edges into its attention mechanism.

<h2 id="theoretical-aspects-of-expressivity">Theoretical aspects of expressivity</h2>

<p>These are the three main facts from the paper,</p>

<ol>
  <li>With appropriate weights and \(\phi\), GCN<d-cite key="kipf2017semisupervisedclassificationgraphconvolutional"></d-cite>, GraphSAGE<d-cite key="hamilton2018inductiverepresentationlearninglarge"></d-cite>, and GIN<d-cite key="xu2019powerfulgraphneuralnetworks"></d-cite> are all <b>special cases</b> of a Graphormer.</li>
  <li>Graphormer is better than architectures that are limited by the 1-WL test. (so <b>all</b> traditional GNNs!)</li>
  <li>With appropriate weights, <b>every node</b> representation in the output can be MEAN-READOUT.</li>
</ol>

<p>«««&lt; HEAD
The <a href="#spatial-encoding">spatial encoding</a> provides the model with important geometric information. Observe that with an appropriate \(b_{\phi(v_i, v_j)}\), the model can <b>find (learn)</b> neighbours for any \(v_i\) and thus easily implement <b>mean-statistics (GCN!)</b>. By knowing the degree (some form of <a href="#centrality-encoding">centrality encoding</a>), mean-statistics can be transformed into sum-statistics; it (indirectly) follows that various statistics can be learned by different heads, which leads to varied representations and allows GraphSAGE, GIN or GCN to be modeled as a Graphormer.</p>

<p>Fact 2 follows from Fact 1, with GIN being the most powerful traditional GNN, which can theoretically identify all graphs distinguishable by the 1-WL test, as it is now a special case of Graphormer. The latter can do the same (&amp; more!).</p>

<p>More importantly, Fact 3 implies that Graphormer allows the flow of <i>Global</i> (and Local) information within the network. This truly sets the network apart from traditional GNNs, which can only aggregate local information up to a fixed radius (or depth).</p>

<p>Traditional GNNs are <i>designed</i> to prevent this type of flow, as with their architecture, this would lead to over-smoothening. However, the clever design around \([VNode]\) prevents this from happening in Graphormer. The addition of a supernode along with Attention and the learnable \(b_{\phi(v_i, v_j)}\) facilitate this, the \([VNode]\) can relay global information, and the attention mechanism can selectively choose from there.</p>

We also provide explicit mathematical equations on how the above claims can be realized, feel free to skip them.</p>
<details><summary>Proof(s) for Fact 1</summary>
<p>For each type of aggregation, we provide simple function and weight definitions that achieve it,</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<b>Mean Aggregate</b> :
    <ul>
      <li>Set \(b_{\phi(v_i, v_j)} = 0\) when \(\phi(v_i, v_j) = 1\) and \(-\infty\) otherwise,</li>
      <li>Set \(W_Q = 0, W_K = 0\) and let \(W_V = I\) (Identity matrix), using these,</li>
      <li>
\[h^{(l)}_{v_i} = \sum_{v_j \in N(v_i)} softmax(A_{ij}) * (W_v * h^{(l-1)}_{v_j}) \implies h^{(l)}_{v_i} = \frac{1}{|N(v_i)|}*\sum_{v_j \in N(v_i)} h^{(l-1)}_{v_j}\]
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<b>Sum Aggregate</b> :
    <ul>
      <li>For this, we just need to get the mean aggregate and then multiply by \(\|N(v_i)\|\),</li>
      <li>Loosely, the degree can be extracted from <a href="link_to_centrality_eqn">centrality-encoding</a> by an attention head, and then the FFN can multiply this to the learned mean aggregate, the latter part is a direct consequence of the universal approximation theorem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<b>Max Aggregate</b> :
    <ul>
      <li>For this one we assume that if we have \(t\) dimensions in our hidden state, we <i>also</i> have t heads.</li>
      <li>The proof is such that each Head will extract the maximum from neighbours, clearly, to only keep immediate neighbours around, we can use the same formulation for \(b\) and \(\phi\) as in the mean aggregate.</li>
      <li>Using \(W_K = e_t\) (t-th unit vector), \(W_K = e_t\) and \(W_Q = 0\) (Identity matrix), we can get a pretty good approximation to the max aggregate. To get the full deal however, we need a <i>hard-max</i> instead of the <i>soft-max</i> being used; to accomplish this we finally consider the bias in the query layer (i.e., something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nn.Linear(in_dim, out_dim, use_bias=True)</code>), set it to \(T \cdot I\) with a high enough \(T\) (temperature), this will make the soft-max behave like a hard-max.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</details>

<p>Fact 2 follows from Fact 1, with GIN being the most powerful traditional GNN, which can theoretically identify all graphs distinguishable by the 1-WL test, as it is now a special case of Graphormer. 
The latter can do the same (&amp; more!).</p>
<details><summary>The WL Test and an example for Fact 2</summary>
<p>First we need to fix some notation for the WL test. 
Briefly, the formulation can be expressed as -</p>

\[c^{(k+1)}(v) = HASH(c^{(k)}(v), \{c^{(k)}(u)\}_{u \in N(v)} )\]

<p>where \(c^{(k)}(v)\) is the \(k^{th}\) iteration representation (color for convenience) of node \(v\) and importantly \(HASH\) is an <i>injective</i> hash function. 
Additionally, all nodes with the same color have the same feature vector</p>

<p>Given this, consider the following graphs -</p>

<p>The hashing process converges in one iteration itself, now the 1-WL test would count number of colors and that vector would act as the final graph representation, which for both of the graphs will be \([0, 0, 4, 2]\) (i.e., \([count(a), count(b), count(x), count(y)]\)), even though they are different, the 1-WL test fails to distinguish them. 
There are several such cases and thus it can be said traditional GNNs are fairly limited in their expressivity.</p>

<p>However for the graphormer, Shortest Path Distances (SPD) directly affects attention weights (because the paper uses SPD as \(\phi(v_i, v_j)\)), and if we look at the SPD sets for the two types of nodes (red and blue) in both the graphs, (we have ordered according to the BFS traversal by top left red node, though any ordering would suffice)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Left graph -
    <ul>
      <li>Red nodes - \(\{ 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3 \}\)</li>
      <li>Blue nodes - \(\{1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2\}\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Right graph -
    <ul>
      <li>Red nodes - \(\{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3\}\)</li>
      <li>Blue nodes - \(\{1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2\}\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What is important is not that red and blue nodes have a different SPD set, <u><i>but that these two types of nodes have different SPD sets across the two graphs</i></u>. This signal can help the model distinguish the two graphs and is the reason why Graphormer is better than 1-WL test limited architectures.</p>

<p>More importantly, Fact 3 implies that Graphormer allows the flow of <i>Global</i> (and Local) information within the network. 
This truly sets the network apart from traditional GNNs, which can only aggregate local information up to a fixed radius (or depth).</p>

<p>Traditional GNNs are <i>designed</i> to prevent this type of flow, as with their architecture, this would lead to over-smoothening. 
However, the clever design around [VNode] prevents this from happening in Graphormer. 
The addition of a supernode along with Attention and the learnable \(b_{\phi(v_i, v_j)}\) facilitate this, the [VNode] can relay global information, and the attention mechanism can selectively choose from there.</p>

<details><summary>Over-smoothening</summary>
<p>Over-smoothening results in traditional GNNs when the neighbourhood considered for feature aggregation is too large. 
If we build a 10 layer deep network for a graph where the maximum distance bwteen any two nodes is 10, then all nodes will aggregate information from all other nodes, and the final representation will be the same for all nodes.
Thus näively adding a [VNode] / Super Node would lead to over-smoothening in traditional GNNs.</p>
</details>

<p>Operations such as MEAN_READOUT involve aggregation over all nodes, making it a global operation.
Given that Fact 3 implies that every node representation can be MEAN-READOUT, this means that the model can learn to selectively propagate global information using the [VNode].</p>
<details><summary>Proof for Fact 3</summary>
<p>Setting \(W_Q = W_K = 0\), and the bias terms in both to be \(T \cdot 1\) (where T is temperature), as well as, setting \(W_V = I\) (Identity matrix), with a large enough \(T\) (much larger than the scale of \(b_{\phi(v_i, v_j)}\), so that \(T^2 1 1^T\) can dominate), we can get MEAN-READOUT on all nodes. Note that while this proof doesn’t require [VNode], it should be noted that, the [Vnode] is very important to establish a <b>balance</b> between this completely global flow and the local flow. As in a normal setting, with the \(T\) not being too large, the only way for global information is through the [VNode], as the \(b_{\phi(v_i, v_j)}\) would most likely limit information from nodes that are very far.</p>

<p>The researchers conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate Graphormer’s performance against state-of-the-art models like GCN<d-cite key="kipf2017semisupervisedclassificationgraphconvolutional"></d-cite>, GIN<d-cite key="xu2019powerfulgraphneuralnetworks"></d-cite>, DeeperGCN<d-cite key="li2020deepergcnneedtraindeeper"></d-cite>, and the Transformer-based GT<d-cite key="dwivedi2021generalizationtransformernetworksgraphs"></d-cite>.</p>

<p>Two variants of Graphormer, <em>Graphormer</em> (L=12, d=768) and a smaller <em>GraphormerSMALL</em> (L=6, d=512), were evaluated on the <a href="https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OGB-LSC</a> quantum chemistry regression challenge (PCQM4M-LSC), one of the largest graph-level prediction dataset with over 3.8 million graphs.</p>

<p>The results, as shown in Table 1, demonstrate Graphormer’s significant performance improvements over previous top-performing models such as GIN-VN, DeeperGCN-VN, and GT.</p>

Notably, Graphormer did not encounter over-smoothing issues, with both training and validation errors continuing to decrease as model depth and width increased, thereby going beyond the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/06-theory.pdf#page=46" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1-WL test</a>. Additionally, Graph Transformer (GT) showed no performance gain despite a significant increase in parameters from GT to GT-Wide, highlighting Graphormer’s scaling capabilities.

Notably, As pointed out in the <a href="#vnode">VNode</a> section, Graphormer does not encounter over-smoothing issues, with both training and validation errors continuing to decrease as model depth and width increased. 
Additionally, Graph Transformer (GT) showed no performance gain despite a significant increase in parameters from GT to GT-Wide, highlighting Graphormer’s scaling capabilities. 
We also observe a strong overfitting (&gt;0.045 difference between train and validate MAE) for Transformer based models. 
This can be attributed to its special structure, as it can extract more information from the training data.</p>

<details><summary>Graph Trasformer (GT)</summary>
<p>The Graph Transformer is an architecture which works on heterogeneous graphs.
It uses a transformer to create several graphs at runtime by combining several meta-paths and the using a traditional GNN to aggregate information.
As a transformer is not involved in the information relay stage, it’s expressivity is mid-way between a traditional GNN and a Graphormer.</p>

<p>Further experiments for graph-level prediction tasks were performed on datasets from popular leaderboards like <a href="https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/graphprop/#ogbg-mol" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OGBG</a> (MolPCBA, MolHIV) and <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/paper/benchmarking-graph-neural-networks" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">benchmarking-GNNs</a> (ZINC), which also showed Graphormer consistently outperforming top-performing GNNs.</p>

<p>By using the ensemble with ExpC<d-cite key="yang2020breakingexpressivebottlenecksgraph"></d-cite>, Graphormer was able to reach a 0.1200 MAE and win the graph-level track in the OGB Large-Scale Challenge.</p>

The authors further fine-tune GROVER on MolHIV and MolPCBA to achieve competitive performance along with supplying additional molecular features such as morgan fingerprints and other 2D features. Note that the Random Forest model fitted on these features alone outperforms the GNN model, showing the huge boost in performance granted by the same.
