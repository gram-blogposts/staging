## Introduction
Neural fields (NeFs) <d-cite key="xie2022neural"></d-cite> have emerged as a promising paradigm for representing continuous signals in a variety of domains. 
Recently, they have been used as a continuous alternative for classical discrete signal representations - showing promising results especially in higher dimensional settings where traditional grid-based methods often fall short <d-cite key="dupont2022data"></d-cite>. 

A major limitation of NeFs as representation is their lack of interpretibility and preservation of geometric information. In this blog post, we delve into the recent advancements presented in the paper "Grounding Continuous Representations in Geometry: Equivariant Neural Fields" <d-cite key="wessels2024ENF"></d-cite>, and explore how Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) enhance the capabilities of NeFs through geometric grounding and equivariance properties. We then elaborate upon their use as a representation by discussing the paper "Space-Time Continuous PDE Forecasting using Equivariant Neural Fields" <d-cite key="knigge2024pde"></d-cite>, which demonstrates the use of ENFs in modelling spatiotemporal dynamics. An important upcomming field of research, in which the geometric grounding of NeFs is crucial.

### The Evolution of Neural Fields

Neural fields are functions that map spatial coordinates to feature representations. For instance, a neural field $$ f_{\theta}: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^c $$ can map pixel coordinates $$ x $$ to RGB values to represent images. These fields are typically parameterized by neural networks, which are optimized to approximate a target signal $$f_\theta$$ within a reconstruction task. Although this gives rise to continuous representations, for multiple signals, the weights $$\theta_f$$ are optimized separately for each signal $$ f $$, leading to a lack of shared structure across different signals and the need to train different seperate models.

Neural fields are functions that map spatial coordinates to feature representations. Specifically, a neural field $$ f_{\theta}: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^c $$ can map pixel coordinates $$ x $$ to RGB values, thereby representing images. These fields are typically parameterized by neural networks and optimized to approximate a target signal $$f_\theta$$ within a reconstruction task.

While this approach results in continuous representations, it also presents a significant drawback. For multiple signals, the weights $$\theta_f$$ must be optimized separately for each signal $$ f $$ This leads to a lack of shared structure across different signals and necessitates training separate models for each individual signal.

<div class="caption">
    Neural Fields. when applied to images, a neural field $f_\theta$ maps coordinates $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$ to pixel values $I(x) \in \mathbb{R}^3$.
</div>

Conditional Neural Fields (CNFs) extend this concept of neural fields by introducing a conditioning variable $$ z_f $$ that modulates the neural field for a specific signal $$ f $$. This enhancement allows CNFs to effectively represent an entire dataset of signals $$ f \in \mathcal{D} $$ using a single, shared set of weights $$ \theta $$ along with a set of unique conditioning variables $$ z_f $$. Since these representations are signal-specific, they latents can be used as a representation in downstream tasks. This approach has been successful in various tasks, including classification <d-cite key="dupont2022data"></d-cite>, segmentation <d-cite key="zhang20233dshape2vecset"></d-cite>, and even solving partial differential equations<d-cite key="yin2022continuous"></d-cite> <d-cite key="knigge2024pde"></d-cite>.

</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

However, conventional CNFs often lack geometric interpretability, they are able to capture textures and appearances which is shown by their performance in reconstruction. However, they do struggle to encode explicit geometric information necessary for tasks requiring spatial reasoning. Think for example of simple geometric transformations like rotations or translations, which are not inherently captured by CNFs; it is unclear how these transformations would manifest in the latent space.

### Introducing Equivariant Neural Fields

Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) address this limitation by grounding neural field representations in geometry. ENFs use latent point clouds as conditioning variables, where each point is a tuple consisting of a pose and a context vector. This grounding ensures that transformations in the field correspond to transformations in the latent space, a property known as equivariance.

</div>
<div class="caption">
    Equivariant Neural Fields parameterize the conditioning variable $z$ as an attributed point-cloud of poses $p_i$ and corresponding context vectors $\mathbf{c}_i$: $z = \{ (p_i, \mathbf{c}_i \}_{i=0}^N$, explicitly grounding the latent space in geometry. 
</div>

### Key Properties of ENFs

- **Equivariance**: If the field transforms, the latent representation transforms accordingly. This property ensures that the latent space preserves geometric patterns, enabling better geometric reasoning.
- **Weight Sharing**: ENFs utilize shared weights over similar local patterns, leading to more efficient learning.
- **Localized Representations**: The latent point sets in ENFs enable localized cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing interpretability and allowing unique field editing capabilities.

### Use of Neural Fields in downstream tasks
As brief interjection, we provide some background on how NeFs are used in downstream tasks. As (a subset of) model NeF parameters are optimized reconstruct specific samples, these parameters may be used as a representation of their corresponding signals. These representations serve as input to downstream models for tasks such as classification, segmentation or even solving partial differential equations.

<div class="caption">

    In ENFs instead the latent point sets $z_j$ are used as input to the downstream model, allowing for preservation of geometric information in the downstream task through the use of equivariant graph models.
</div>

## Methodology
We now delve into the technical details of ENF, focusing on the key components that enable the model to ground continuous representations in geometry.

### Requirements for Equivariant Neural Fields
The equivariance or steerability property of ENFs can be formally defined as:

$$ 
\forall g \in G : f_{\theta}(g^{-1}x, z) = f_{\theta}(x, gz). 
$$

This property ensures that if the field as a whole transforms, the latent representation will transform in a consistent manner. This is crucial for maintaining geometric coherence in the latent space.
In order reason about the application of a group action on $z$, the authors equip the latent space with a group action by defining $z$ as a set of tuples $$(p_i, \mathbf{c}_i)$$, where $G$ acts on $z$ by transforming poses $$p_i: gz = \{(gp_i, \mathbf{c}_i)\}_{i=1}^N$$.

For a neural field to satisfy the steerability property, the authors show it must be bi-invariant with respect to both coordinates and latents. 
This means that the field $ f_{\theta} $ must remain unchanged under group transformations applied to both the input coordinates and the latent point cloud, i.e.:

$$
\forall g \in G: f_\theta(gx, gz) = f_\theta(x, z).
$$

This observation is leveraged to define the architecture of ENFs, ensuring that the model is equivariant by design.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Commutative diagram illustrating the steerability of ENFs. 
</div>

### Equivariance through Bi-invariant Cross-Attention
ENFs utilize a bi-invariant cross-attention mechanism to parametrize the neural fields in order to achieve the aforementioned steerability property.
The cross-attention operation is defined as:
$ f_{\theta}(x, z) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{att}(x, z) v(a(x, p_i), c_i) $
where $ a(x, p_i) $ is an invariant pair-wise attribute that captures the geometric relationship between the coordinate $ x $ and the latent pose $ p_i $, 
ensuring that the cross-attention operation respects the aforementioned bi-invariance condition.

Note that the choice of bi-invariant is related to the choice of group $$G$$ and the specific application domain. For example,
in natural images $$G$$ may be the group of 2D Euclidean transformations, while in 3D shape representations $$G$$ may be the group of 3D rigid transformations,
leading to different choices of bi-invariant $$a(x, p_i)$$. For a better understanding of bi-invariant properties we refer to <d-cite key="bekkers2023fast"></d-cite> which shows optimal invariant attributes in terms of expressivity for different groups.

### Enforcing Locality in Equivariant Neural Fields
To enforce locality, ENFs incorporate a Gaussian window into the attention mechanism. 
This ensures that each coordinate receives attention primarily from nearby latents, akin to the localized kernels in convolutional networks. 
This locality improves the interpretability of the latent representations, as specific features can be related to specific latent points $(p_i, \mathbf{c}_i)$.
Moreover, locality also improves parameter-efficiency by allowing for weight sharing over similar patterns.

## Experimental Validation
The authors validate the properties of ENFs through various experiments on image and shape datasets, providing 
metrics for reconstruction and downstream classification. Moreover, authors play around with the ENFs latent space
to demonstrate the benefits of having a geometrically grounded latent space. A
separate study by Knigge et al. demonstrates the use of ENFs in modelling spatiotemporal dynamics.

### Image and Shape Reconstruction and Classification
ENFs were evaluated on several image datasets, including CIFAR-10, CelebA, and STL-10. 
The results show that ENFs achieve higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in image reconstruction tasks compared to CNFs. 
This improvement is attributed to the geometric grounding and weight-sharing properties of ENFs.

The classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 shows a significant improvement over conventional CNFs,

The authors also tested ENFs on shape datasets using Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). 
The results indicate that ENFs can effectively represent geometric shapes with high fidelity, 
further validating the geometric interpretability of the latent representations.

### Spatiotemporal Dynamics Modelling

Another usecase for ENFs is highlighted in the paper "Space-Time Continuous PDE Forecasting using Equivariant Neural Fields" <d-cite key="knigge2024pde"></d-cite>.
Authors use the ENF as a continuous state representation for solving partial differential equations; learning to forecast dynamics by modelling them with a Neural ODE as a
flow in the latent space of the ENF. Since PDEs are often defined over continuous domains in terms of local differential operators, ENFs are well-suited to model these dynamics, as
they provide localized continuous representations.
This approach allows for symmetry-preserving continuous forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics,
showing promising results on a variety of PDEs defined over different geometries. An initial state $$\nu_0:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ representing the current state of the PDE
is fit with a corresponding latent $$z_0$$, which is unrolled in latent space with an equivariant graph-based neural ODE $$F_\psi$$.
